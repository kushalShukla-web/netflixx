- **JavaScript:** The core programming language used for building dynamic and interactive features within the app.

- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets bring life to the application by providing stunning visuals and animations.

- ## IMDb API Integration

This project uses the IMDb API to fetch movie and TV show data. To enable this feature:

1. Obtain an IMDb API key by signing up on the [IMDb API website](https://imdb-api.com/).

2. Replace the placeholder API key in `src/services/imdbAPI.js` with your actual IMDb API key.

3. You can then fetch movie and TV show data using the methods provided by `imdbAPI.js`.

### Fetching Movie Details

You can use the `fetchMovieDetails` function to fetch details about a specific movie:

```javascript
import { fetchMovieDetails } from './services/imdbAPI';

async function getMovieDetails(movieId) {
  try {
    const movieData = await fetchMovieDetails(movieId);
    console.log('Movie details:', movieData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching movie details:', error);
  }
}

getMovieDetails('tt1234567');
